                        <p><b>1. Services</b></p>
                        <p>a. Description of Services</p>
                        <p>Revords provides the User with access to the loyalty rewards software platform ("Services"). Through the use of these Services the User may receive the following offerings and Rewards that are offered by Merchants and authorized Third Party Sites.</p>
                        <p>b. Rewards</p>
                        <p>By using the Services, User may have the opportunity to qualify for Rewards through promotional campaigns offered by merchants and Third-Party Sites that participate in the Services. All Rewards made available in connection with the Services are promotional only and have no cash value. User shall have no property value in any Rewards. Such Rewards are made available directly by the relevant merchant providing such Reward (“Rewards Provider”), and not Revords, and are redeemable solely for the applicable goods or services of the relevant Rewards Provider as may be determined by such Rewards Provider. The Rewards Provider, not Revords, is the provider of the Rewards and such goods and services and is solely responsible for redeeming any Rewards User obtains. Revords will have no liability if a Rewards Provider refuses or fails to honor any Reward. In addition, the following terms and conditions also apply to all Rewards:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Rewards may not be cashed out or transferred into any other medium of exchange.</li>
                            <li>Rewards are non-transferable.</li>
                            <li>Redemption frequency is determined by the Rewards Provider.</li>
                            <li>Use of Rewards relating to alcoholic beverages is at the sole discretion of the Rewards Provider and is subject to compliance with applicable law.</li>
                            <li>Rewards cannot be combined with any other rewards, offers, vouchers, third-party certificates, coupons, or promotions, unless otherwise specified by the Rewards Provider.</li>
                            <li>
                                Reproduction or sale of any Reward is prohibited.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Any attempted redemption not consistent with these Terms or any other restrictions imposed by the Rewards Provider or Revords (including any Reward-specific terms associated with a Reward) will render the Reward void.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Rewards are void to the extent prohibited by law.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Rewards may be applied only to the applicable products or services sold by the Rewards Provider that are the subject of such Rewards as determined by such Rewards Provider.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>A Rewards Provider may discontinue its rewards program and their participation with Revords’ Services at any time. Revords also reserves the right to terminate a Rewards Provider’s rewards program and their participation with the Services at any time. Upon termination of a Rewards Program for whatever reason, all Rewards will become null and void and will not be redeemable for any good, service, or any other value, financial or otherwise.</p>

                        <p><b>3. Legalities</b></p>
                        <p>a. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</p>
                        <p>The Services and terms of Use are governed by the Laws of the state of Illinois and are subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of Cook County Illinois. Any proceedings, whether court or arbitration initiated by either party shall be held in Cook County Illinois or where appropriate via teleconference.</p>
                        <p>If any provision of these Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the User and Revords nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to Revords’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms remain in full force and effect.</p>
                        <p>b. Arbitration and Class Waiver</p>
                        <p>Any dispute or claim relating in any way to User’s use of the Services, other than a court action to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights, (“Covered Disputes”) will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that User may assert claims in small claims court if User’s claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement.</p>
                        <p>There shall be no judge or jury in arbitration, and a court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages) and must follow the terms of these Terms as a court would.

                        </p>
                        <p>This arbitration and class waiver agreement not only applies to Covered Disputes between the User and Revords, but also to Covered Disputes between the User and Reward Providers, other merchants who participate in Revords Services, or vendors who perform services for Revords.

                        </p>
                        <p>c. Indemnification

                        </p>
                        <p>User shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Revords, their officers, owners, affiliates, employees, vendors, and contractors from and against any and all claims related to or arising out of:
                        </p>

                            <li>User’s breach of any term, condition, representation, warranty, duty, and/or obligations set forth in the Terms.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>d. Limitation of Liability</p>
                        <p>The user expressly understands and agrees that Revords, its affiliates, officers, employees, directors, and agents shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages, or damages for loss of profits, including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, use, data, or other intangible losses (even if Revords has been advised of the possibility of such damages), whether based on contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or otherwise, resulting from:
                            <br /><br /> (i) the use or the inability to use the services;
                            <br /><br />(ii) the cost of procurement of substitute goods and services resulting from any goods, data, information, or services purchased or obtained, messages received, or transactions entered into through or from the services;

                            <br /><br /> (iv) statements or conduct of any third party on the services; or
                            <br /><br /> (v) any other matter relating to the services.</p>
                        <p>In no event shall Revords’ total liability to the user for all damages, losses, or causes of action exceed the amount the user has paid Revords in the last six (6) months or one hundred dollars ($100), whichever is less.</p>
                        <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages. Accordingly, some of the above limitations may not apply to the user. If the user is dissatisfied with any portion of the services or with these terms of service, the user’s sole and exclusive remedy is to discontinue use of the services.</p>
                        <p>e. Time limitation</p>
                        <p>The User agrees that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Services or these Terms must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.

                        </p>
